The basic data required for the analysis are therefore an estimate of the intervention effect and its standard error from each study.


Estimates and their standard errors may be entered directly into RevMan under the ‘Generic inverse variance’ outcome. The software will undertake fixed-effect meta-analyses and random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird) meta-analyses, along with assessments of heterogeneity. 
For ratio measures of intervention effect, the data should be entered as natural logarithms (for example as a log odds ratio and the standard error of the log odds ratio).


To compute a summary odds ratio (OR), we used the adjusted OR and its 95% CI in all analyses. The hazard ratio (HR) was considered as the OR directly
