Main results:
- Description and characteristics of studies
- Reproducibility, excess significance and credibility ceilings
- Summary of effect sizes, heterogeneity between studies, and bias tests
(small study effects and publication bias)
- Consistency of results between studies
- Grading of evidence (we need to add something regarding effect size to
the adiposity BMJ criteria if possible, otherwise apply as they have)
- Funnel and forest plot of all included studies

Additional:
- Analysis of quality of each meta-analysis: we'll end up having to
randomise to select ~10-15% of studies and assess with one of the
available tools.

Figures and tables:
- Study flow-chart
- Description of biomarkers, outcomes and sites
- Consistency of results:
    + Association of meta-analysis summary effect sizes with inverse of
the variance (as discussed today for Fig. 1 of the adiposity and cancer
BMJ paper)
    + Correlation of summary effect size in each study assessed
(meta-analysis) and  summary risk statistic in the  largest individual
study. (see the VD umbrella BMJ paper, supplementary info)
    + Assessment of I^2, upper and lower CIs
    + Distributions of Egger's
    + ?
- General characteristics of non-overlapping meta-analyses (this can be
a single, expanded supplementary table 1 with a reduced main table 1)
- Summary of evidence grading (a summary table)

Supplementary:
- Excluded studies table
- Sensitivity analysis with credibility ceilings
- Details of evidence grading for each study (as supplementary table)

Additional:
- How to take advantage of duplicate studies? Check overall concordance,
number of duplicated studies, degree of overlap. e.g. How much research
is wasted/low quality? Are results largely concordant?
- Meta-regression needed?
