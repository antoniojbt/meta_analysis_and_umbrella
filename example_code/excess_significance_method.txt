Evaluation of excess significance bias
- "We assessed excess significance bias by evaluating whether the observed number of studies with nominally statistically significant results (“positive” studies, P<0.05) in the published literature was different from the expected number of studies with statistically significant results.25"
- "The expected number of statistically significant studies in each meta-analysis was calculated from the sum of the statistical power estimates for each component study using an algorithm from a non-central t distribution.2627"
- "The power estimates of each component study depend on the plausible effect size for the tested association, which was assumed to be the effect of the largest study (that is, the smallest standard error) in each meta-analysis.28" 
- "Sensitivity analyses were conducted using the summary fixed and random effects estimates as alternative plausible effect sizes. Excess significance for individual meta-analyses was determined at P≤0.10.25"

Steps:
- Extract all studies and mark individual studies that are significant (P<0.05) for each meta-analysis {Ioannidis, 2007}
- Estimate the plausible effect size for each meta-analysis, i.e. extract the effect of the largest study for each meta-analysis {Tsilidis, 2012}
- Calculate the statistical power estimates for each component study (including non-significant) using an algorithm from a non-central t distribution {Tsilidis, 2013}{Tsilidis, 2012}
See as an example Meg's: https://github.com/megcupp/Neutrophils-and-Cancer-Prognosis/blob/master/Power%20Calculations
- Calculate the expected number of statistically significant studies for each meta-analysis as the sum of the statistical power estimates (rounded to whole integer) {Tsilidis, 2013}{Tsilidis, 2012}
- Perform sensitivity analysis with fixed and random effects estimates as alternative plausible effect sizes 
- Consider excess significance for each meta-analysis as P≤0.10 {Ioannidis, 2007}
- Use as criterion for grading strength of evidence {Kyrgiou, 2017}
