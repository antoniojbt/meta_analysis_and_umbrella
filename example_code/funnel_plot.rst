Funnel plot

Title


Legend
Scatterplot of effect size versus study precision
Each dot represents a study; vertical and diagonal lines show the arithmetic mean and corresponding 95% confidence interval; y-axis, study precision (standard error or sample size);  x-axis, study results (odds ratio, measured average effect, etc.).


Method



Interpretation
Studies with high precision should appear closer to the mean while those with low precision will spread on either (asymmetric) or both (symmetric) sides. Deviations can indicate publication bias or small study effects.

Differences in populations studied may yield biases in relation to levels of precision and effect sizes (e.g. studies with high precision may have different effect sizes to those of low precision due to different populations examined).


Publication bias: failure to include all relevant trials because they were not accessible (published).

Reporting bias can include publication, language and citation biases.

If the number of studies is less than 10 funnel plots may be unreliable in detection of publication bias.

Statistical tests

Eggerâ€™s test
The null hypothesis is that symmetry exists
