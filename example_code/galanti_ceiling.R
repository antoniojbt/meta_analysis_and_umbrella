# Inflate confidence intervals for meta-analysis
# Input vectors of means, variances and probabilities of length equal to the 
# number of studies included in meta-analysis
# The variance will be inflated to leave a prob% chance to observe a result 
# on the opposite direction than the point estimate
# If the 'prob' argument is a single number, it is repeated for all studies
# Result: a list with [1] the new data [2] the output of the meta-analysis
# and a forest plot is created
# Needs the subroutine ci.plot to be downloaded from #http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/29387.html
