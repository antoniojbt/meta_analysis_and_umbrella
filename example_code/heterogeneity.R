# Logging
# TO DO: move to a separate script

##Set working directory and file locations and names of required inputs:

# Working directory:
setwd('/Users/antoniob/Documents/')

#Direct output to file as well as printing to screen (plots aren't redirected though, each done separately). 
#Input is not echoed to the output file either.

output_file <- file(paste("R_session_output_",Sys.Date(),".txt", sep=""))
output_file
sink(output_file, append=TRUE, split=TRUE, type = c("output", "message"))

#If the script can run from end to end, use source() with echo to execute and save all input 
#to the output file (and not truncate 150+ character lines):
#source(script_file, echo=TRUE, max.deparse.length=10000)

#Record start of session and locations:
Sys.time()
print(paste('Working directory :', getwd()))
getwd()

##TO DO extract parameters:

# Re-load a previous R session, data and objects:
#load('R_session_saved_image_order_and_match.RData', verbose=T)

# Filename to save current R session, data and objects at the end:
R_session_saved_image <- paste('R_session_saved_image_','.RData', sep='')
R_session_saved_image

# Run with cmd arguments:
args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE)

# What about detecting publication bias?
# Which one is more appropriate in our case?
# Detection of biases
# Egger’s linear regression method
# Begg and Mazumdar’s rank correlation method 
# The Duval and Tweedie’s trim and fill method, on meta-analysis of continuous data.

# *Begg and Mazumdar test: rank correlation test
# This test is based on the correlation between a standardized treatment effect and within trial variance. 
# The null hypotehsis of NO bias is rejected at the significance level alpha. Instead of conducting a statistical test, the Kendall's tau with (1 - a) 
# confidence interval can be reported in a systematic review. It has been shown that the power of Begg and Mazumdar test is poor. 
# Use the metabias functgion of the R package meta like this:
# example: >metabias(ms1, method="rank")
# Alternative hypothesis: asymmetry in funnel plot. So if p-value is LESS than the predefined alpha value (e.g. 0.05) then we will reject 
# the null hypothesis so the conclusion in such a case will be: 
# Rejecting the null hypothesis (of symmetry in the funnel plot) and and accepting the alternative hypothesis that indicates marked asymmetry 
# of the funnel plot.


# *Egger's test: Linear regression test
# This was proposed by Egger et al [Paper Citation: Egger, M., Davey Smith, G., Schneider, M., & Minder, C. (1997). 
# Bias in meta-analysis detected by a simple, graphical test. BMJ: British Medical Journal, 315(7109), 629–634.]
# This test is based in a simple linear regression 
# The appeoach is justified by the intuitive argument that in the presence of publication bias small studies with non-significant or negative results 
# are less likely to be published. 
# Null-hypothesis: no bias in a meta-analysis 
# Assumption of test: Linearity still holds in the presence of bias
# Again for this test use the metabias functgion of the R package meta like this:
# example: >metabias (ms1, method="linreg")

# A Comparison of Methods to Detect Publication Bias for Meta-analysis of Continuous Data
# try it
# mortal <- read.csv("mortcorrect.rda", as.is=TRUE)
# mortal
# View(mortal)
metabin(deaddef, alldef, deadnotdef, allnotdef, studlab=study, data=mortal, method="Inverse", sm= "OR")
# now do the eggers test
mort1 <- metabin(deaddef, alldef, deadnotdef, allnotdef, studlab=study, data=mortal, method="Inverse", sm= "OR")
metabias(mort1, method="linreg")

# RESULTS
# e.g.: so in this case Eggers test shows a significant p-value (0.0035) which is less than 0.05 
# and thus this leads to rejecting the null hypothesis, of symmetry in the funnel plot.
 
# *Small study effects: general term for the phenomenon of smaller studies to sometimes show different, often larger treatment effects
# than larger ones (Sterne 2000). 
# Funnel plot asymmetry also known as "small study effects". But it is wrongly equated with publication or other reporting biases. 
# Funnel plot = scatter plot that shows the effect estimates from individual studies against some measure of each study's size or precision.
# Usually standard error of the effect estimate is chosen as the measure of study size and it is plotted on the vertical axis with a reversed 
# scale that places larger, more powerful studies at the top. Smaller studies would scatter at the bottom 
# from (Sterne 2011)
